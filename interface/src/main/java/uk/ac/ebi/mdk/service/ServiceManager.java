    /**
     * Provides creation of a proxy service where multiple services can be combined
     * into a single instance. The proxy uses a the code generation library (cglib)
     * MethodInterceptor to dispatch methods to the sub-services. Methods in the super type
     * {@see QueryService} will be invoked across all delegates (e.g. setMaxResults(int))
     * whilst other method methods are invoked on a first come first served with the order
     * being determined by the priority given by the {@see ServiceType}. This means if you
     * have two services providing the IUPAC name only the highest priority service will be
     * invoked. This proxying has some overhead but method calls are cached the following benchmark
     * shoes the difference over 80,000 inovocations of two service calls.
     *
     * <table>
     *     <tr><td>Aggregated</td><td>19,368 ms</td></tr>
     *     <tr><td>Separated</td><td>19,643 ms</td></tr>
     * </table>
     *
     *
     * To create an custom aggregated service you need provide an interface describing your
     * requirements and pass it as the service class parameter. Currently the interface
     * does not need to public and it is possible to use inner-interfaces:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *
     * public class AggregatedServiceExample {
     *
     *    interface MyCustomService extends StructureService,
     *                                      PreferredNameService {
     *    }
     *
     *    public static void main(String[] args) {
     *        ServiceManager  manager = DefaultServiceManager.getInstance();
     *        MyCustomService service = manager.createService(ChEBIIdentifier.class,
     *                                                        MyCustomService.class);
     *
     *        service.getPreferredName(identifier); // in PreferredName
    *         service.getStructure(identifier);     // in StructureService
     *    }
     *
     * }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * It is also possible to make the interface generically typed:
     * <pre>{@code
     * interface MyCustomService<I extends Identifier> extends StructureService<I>,
     *                                                         PreferredNameService<I> {
     * }
     * }</pre>
     *
     * or even:
     * <pre>{@code
     * interface MyChEBIService extends StructureService<ChEBIIdentifier>,
     *                                  PreferredNameService<ChEBIIdentifier> {
     * }
     * }</pre>
     *
     * If you are writing an algorithm to consuming the service you don't need to provide the interface
     * required. Instead you can use generic typing on methods. In the following example we create a new type
     * 'S' which we say must implement both {@see PreferredNameService} and {@see StructureService}. We
     * then provide 'S' as a parameter type. Subsequently this allows the user of the method to provide their
     * own implementation which could be via an aggregated service or for example a database connection.
     * The algorithm should not be thinking about how it will be retrieving the object data but rather
     * what it will be doing with the object data. In the below example we do not care how we get the name
     * and structure we just describe that we need and allow another class to provide it.
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     * public <S extends PreferredNameService & StructureService>
     *  void printNameAndAtomCount(S service, Identifier identifier) {
     *    System.out.println( service.getPreferredName(identifier) );
     *    System.out.println( service.getStructure(identifier).getAtomCount() );
     * }
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param identifierClass
     * @param serviceClass
     * @param <I>
     * @param <S>
     *
     * @return
     */
