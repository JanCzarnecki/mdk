# Model Development Kit (MDK)

The MDK is a modular [Java](http://www.java.com) library for simplifying procedures when handling metabolic models
and metabolomes. The kit was written at [EMBL-EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) by [John May](http://www.github.com/johnmay)
and [Pablo Moreno](http://www.github.com/pcm32). The library was previously named CheMet after the
[Cheminformatics and Metabolism group](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/steinbeck).

* Name derived from the largest component The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)

### Key Points
*    intuitive object model for handling metabolic network/model data (expandable to other systems)
*    simplified data/chemical annotation of entities
*    service framework using WebServices and NoSQL local storage
*    semantic annotation of cross-references
*    fast read/write of models
*    import/resolution of multiple formats
*    incubation/testing for tools prior to deployment in CDK
*    core library used by Metingear: The Metabolic Development Environment
